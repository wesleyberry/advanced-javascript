Global Execution Context:
    processes are creation and exection.
    1. creation
        creates global object
        creates this (window)
        assigns undefined to variables (hoisting)/secures memory for values
        declare functions in memory
    2. Execution
        global object
        assign values to variables
        run functions
Hoisting:
    during the creation phase of the execution context, undefined as assigned to variables as a default values

Closure:
    if a function is nested within another function, the inner function will create a closure over the outer function's execution context.
