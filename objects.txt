object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that is focused around objects instead of functions
Objects - a collection of key-value pairs

Encapsulation - Group related variables into objects

Abstractions - hidden complexities

Inheritance - eliminate redundant code

Polymorphism - technique that allows us to get rid of long statements

Primitives are copied by their value, and objects are copied by their reference

Private Properties and Methods - Hide certain members from the outside

Getter - a function that is used to read a property
